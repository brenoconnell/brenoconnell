# Brendan O'Connell

I recently graduated with a master's degree in Computer Engineering
I have almost 2 years of professional experience in Angular development as a full-stack developer.
I gained practical experience in machine learning and artificial intelligence through projects in university.
Because of these experiences I have keen interests in web development, application development, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
